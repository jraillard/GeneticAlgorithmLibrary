    Algorithm comprehension

    UML diagrams

## 20/11/2018

    Scripts implementation without function code

## 27/12/2018 

    Hotfixes on previous scripts 

    Compute loop method 
        (evaluate => selection => croosbeed/mutation => replacement)

    Population builder

## 14/12/2018

    Selection, Replacement strategies 

    Main implementation

    Comments in code

## 20/12/2018

    Progress.md creation 

    Readme.md edit

    MyIndividual implementation = > first tests : 
                                            - hotfixes on fitness comparators
                                            - hotfixes on strategy method 
                                            - add following test before computing algorithm => nbChildren generated < population 

                                            TODO : make copy of population before doing any operation otherwise it will compromise the algorithm efficiency when combining random strategy with another one
    
    Start computing stop when population stop evolving

## 21/12/2018

    Manage computing stop if population don't evolve anymore

    CheckEntries method to check Compute() entries

    previous todo cancelled => quiet useless

    bestfitness evolution stop condition

    concrete genetic template threaded version  

    MyIndividual Evaluation edit
    
    RAF (BONUS) => TUs       

## 24/12/2018

    File indent correct

    Median compute in Genetic Template correct

    Confluent tests => 
        case implemented seems to confluent to the best value (maybe too fast) : 100 individuals population , 50 iterations => best population
        never go to case when population don't evolve anymore
        never go to case when best fitness individual change
    
    Hotfix on Compute() method => if !CheckEntries must return null so that the algorithm end without any null reference exceptions
	
## 08/01/2019
