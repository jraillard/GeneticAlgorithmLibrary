    MyIndividual implementation = > first tests : 
                                            - hotfixes on fitness comparators
                                            - hotfixes on strategy method 
                                            - add following test before computing algorithm => nbChildren generated < population 

                                            TODO : make copy of population before doing any operation otherwise it will compromise the algorithm efficiency when combining random strategy with another one
    
    Start computing stop when population stop evolving
